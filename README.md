# Pacman
Pacman game made with unity, this is just the Assets and Project Settings folders. The rest is too large for github.

To run this you need to 

- install unity https://unity3d.com/
- create a blank unity project
- copy these Assets and Project Settings folders into the blank project directory, replacing the folders that are there

The game should be runnable in unity after that.
